# Grover's Algorithm: 20-Qubit Quantum Search Simulation

This project demonstrates a large-scale implementation of Grover's quantum search algorithm using 20 qubits, capable of searching through over 1 million database entries with quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms.

## üöÄ Overview

Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup for searching unsorted databases. While a classical algorithm would require O(N) operations to find a specific item in an unsorted database of N items, Grover's algorithm can find it in O(‚àöN) operations.

### Key Features
- **20-qubit implementation**: Searches through 2¬≤‚Å∞ = 1,048,576 database entries
- **Quantum oracle**: Marks the target item in superposition
- **Amplitude amplification**: Uses quantum diffusion to amplify the probability of measuring the marked item
- **Performance analysis**: Visualizes success probability across different iteration counts
